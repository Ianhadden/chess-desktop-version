# chess-desktop-version
Desktop chess game. More features than online version

Notes to self about network stuff:
currently port forwarding set up for port 5555
static ip isn't set up, so go to http://tplinkwifi.net,
login with admin, admin. Under forwarding -> virtual servers
check IP Address, and then check ip of the machine on command
line with ipconfig (Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi IPv4 address).
Confirm they match. If not, change IP in Virtual Server.
Use that IP and 5555 when setting up game.
